# Test Coverage Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive coverage of all Playwright UI tests implemented for the Prompt Hub application. The test suite covers all key functionalities and ensures the application works correctly across Chrome browser and different user interactions.

## Test Priority System

Tests are categorized by priority based on their criticality to the application:

- **P1 (Critical)**: Core functionality tests that must pass for the application to be considered functional
- **P2 (Important)**: Important features that enhance user experience but are not critical for basic functionality
- **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Edge cases, responsive design, and accessibility features
