npm run test:install
```

### **Running Tests**

#### **Option 1: Using npm scripts**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run in debug mode
npm run test:debug
```

#### **Option 2: Using test runner scripts**
```bash
# PowerShell (Windows)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run-tests.ps1 all
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run-tests.ps1 ui

# Batch file (Windows)
run-tests.bat all
run-tests.bat ui

# Direct Playwright commands
npx playwright test
npx playwright test --ui
```

### **Test Commands**
```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/homepage.spec.ts

# Run tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run tests with specific pattern
npx playwright test --grep="should search"

# Show test report
npx playwright show-report
```
