1. "Think step-by-step and show your work"

The most underrated power move. AI literally gets smarter when forced to explain its reasoning.

"I'm stuck on this Excel formula. Think step-by-step and show your work."

Instead of random formulas, you get the logic behind each piece. Works for everything from math to business strategy.

2. "Act as a [specific expert] with 20+ years of experience"

Role-playing but make it specific. Generic

"act as an expert" is trash.

"Act as a marketing director who's launched 50+ SaaS products"

hits different than "act as a marketer." AI channels actual expertise patterns instead of generic advice.

3. "Give me 3 options: conservative, moderate, and aggressive"

The range hack that eliminates decision paralysis.

"I want to ask for a raise. Give me 3 options: conservative, moderate, and aggressive."

You get a spectrum instead of one random suggestion. Perfect for when you're not sure how bold to be.

4. "Before answering, ask me 3 clarifying questions"

Forces AI to gather context instead of assuming. Game-changer for vague problems.

"Help me choose a career path. But before answering, ask me 3 clarifying questions."

AI becomes a consultant instead of a fortune teller.

5. "Explain this like I'm 5, then like I'm a PhD"

The comprehension sandwich. Two explanations = bulletproof understanding.

"Explain blockchain like I'm 5, then like I'm a PhD."

The simple version gives you the core concept, the complex version gives you nuance. Works for literally any topic.

6. "What would [specific person] say about this?"

Perspective-shifting on steroids. But get specific with the person.

"What would Naval Ravikant say about this career decision?"

AI channels their actual thinking patterns from training data. Way more useful than generic advice.

These prompts are thinking frameworks that force AI to process information differently.

Stack them like a boss.

"Act as a 20-year sales veteran. Give me 3 options: conservative, moderate, aggressive. Before answering, ask me 3 clarifying questions about my situation."

Debugging trick: When AI gives terrible responses, 90% of the time it's because you weren't specific enough. Add context, add constraints, add examples. Garbage in = garbage out.

I've used these patterns on everything from technical problems to relationship advice. It's like upgrading from basic Google searches to having actual experts on speed dial.

Pro insight: The "show your work" prompt alone improved my AI interactions significantly. You see the logic, catch errors early, and learn the thinking process. It's like having AI teach you while it helps.

Reality check: Don't overload with every trick at once. Pick 2-3 that fit your specific need. AI handles complexity well but responds better to clear intent.
