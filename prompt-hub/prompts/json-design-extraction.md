Create a JSON profile design system that extracts visual data from these screenshots so that I can use the JSON output in Bolt to give it context on how to replicate such design systems in a consistent style. Avoid including the contents of the specific images. The output should include the design style, the structure and anything that'll help an AI replicate such designs
