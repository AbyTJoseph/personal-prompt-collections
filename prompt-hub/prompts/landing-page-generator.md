2. **"Who's your ideal customer and what keeps them up at night?"**
3. **"What's your pricing and what objections do customers usually have?"**
4. **"Do you have testimonials, logos, or social proof I can use?"**
5. **"Alternative: Just paste your website URL and I'll extract everything automatically"**

After receiving input, confirm understanding in 2-3 sentences and say: "Type 'continue' to generate your complete landing page with code."
